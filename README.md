# Select Line Contents extension

This extension is a fork of the very good [Handy](https://github.com/onecrayon/Handy.novaextension). However since I didn't need the other commands, it only keeps the Select Line Contents command.

### Selections

- **Select Line Contents** (`command option L`): selects the line, excluding leading and trailing whitespace.
